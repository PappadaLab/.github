# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

At the Pappada Lab, we take security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose any security concerns.

To report a security vulnerability, please email us directly at [jacob.schmieder@rockets.utoledo.edu](mailto:jacob.schmieder@rockets.utoledo.edu) and provide us with a detailed description of the vulnerability and any steps or proof of concept code needed to reproduce it. Our team will investigate and respond to your report as quickly as possible.

We prioritize the review and resolution of security vulnerabilities and aim to provide updates on our progress regularly. We kindly request that you refrain from disclosing the issue publicly until we have had an opportunity to address it.

Thank you for helping us keep our repositories and users safe.
